Grasp purification and energizing leg. Also realize increased capacity control and sublimation energies instinctual sexual.",Effects and Benefits,"To understand the beneficial action of this posture requires a brief review of the anatomy and physiology. Remember that all vegetative activity, although unconscious and involuntary, are controlled by the autonomic nervous system, divided into two separate and antagonistic, one playing the accelerator, and the other inhibitor. The balance of these two systems determines the proper functioning of this complex is the physical body of the human being, so to health and longevity. It's about:
a) ortosimpatic system, comprising a double row of nodes, linked together via nerve fibers distributed parallel to the backbone;
b) the parasympathetic system (antagonists for the former) itself having two parts:
1. pneumogastricul or vagus nerve, linked to the brainstem - this bulge between the brain and the spinal cord - and leaves the backbone of the skull where it supports. He especially innervating the heart, lungs, stomach and several other viscera before losing big is the solar plexus nerve node;
2. the pelvic parasympathetic, leaving the spine in the lumbar region to innervate organs lower abdomen and also genitals.
These two parts form a whole, operating harmoniously. It is therefore essential to stimulate and toned in a balanced way. SHALABASANA is valuable because it strengthens the pelvic parasympathetic through the blood supply in the lower spine caused by strong muscle contraction region. In addition, because the position of the head and shoulders secured to the ground during construction, it acts on the throat and neck, especially in the right place where the vagus nerve leaves the spine. That is why the shoulders should remain on the ground and chin must be pushed as far forward as possible. Also, by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, viscera are toned.
SHALABASANA restores suppleness of the spine, especially the lumbar to. Muscles lumbar considerably strengthened, which is important because lack of exercise caused by a sedentary life threatening most civilized people with atrophy of the muscles, which can give rise to displacement of the vertebrae or intervertebral discs, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fifth lumbar vertebra vertebral basis of the whole edifice.
Strengthening the muscles of this region protects us from unpleasantness. Many different cases of lumbago (so-called back pain) are caused by weak muscles or ligaments region. The smallest wrong move can cause shock or sub-luxation consequences here as varied as it is objectionable, for example certain types of sciatica. We note further that poor working positions (leaning) or lifting, even small, can compromise a backbone static unsupported by a strong muscle. SHALABASANA not the only asana which strengthens, but it certainly is one of the most effective in protecting these accidents.
Position locusts recharges ""centers nervous system, particularly those who control the lower abdomen and solar plexus. It acts strongly on the kidneys, massage internal intense, so promotes diuresis. Overall, the entire digestive system and ductless glands are massaged stimulated and toned. This exercise brings a notable improvement in the functioning of the liver and pancreas, enhancing intestinal tone and peristalsis first.
Raising legs involves numerous effects on blood circulation, thus completing SHALABASANA effects reverse positions. First, excess venous blood is gravity discharged from the leg veins, which prevents varicose veins. Arterial blood must fight gravity to reach the feet, so he will abundantly irrigate the lower abdomen and sacral region.
Because spontaneous breath retention that can occur during the execution of SHALABASANA lungs are toned pressure because the whole mass pulmonary alveoli helping to relax and have a greater assimilation of oxygen.
Correcting the defects of curvature of the bottom of the column, stationary entire spine is favorably influenced. This position also essential energy Kundalini awakens dormant, potential at the base of the spine.
SHALABASANA is contraposturƒÉ for PASCHIMOTANASANA, HALASANA and Sarvangasana completing its effects BHUJANGASANA. It brings down faeces collected from ascending colon to the transverse colon, the descending colon and transverse colon to the rectum from it, thereby removing constipation.

8/4/2018 15:54:29,9,asana,vajrasana,Vajrasana,Etymology,"Vajrasana is one of the sitting posture even used for meditation and concentration, whose amazing name literally means ""posture thunder"" or ""lightning"". In other yogic texts, it is also known as the ""diamond posture"".",Performance,"The initial position to perform this posture is kneeling. Before we sat down we remove as much as possible heels, leaving between thumbs toes a distance of 5-6 cm and making sure that your toes do not touch each other. This forms a kind of bed ready ready to get inside her buttocks.
We will let you slow down towards the ground, so you not only get to sit back on his heels but the bed made.
Sit still hands with thumb away within the fingers, the junction between the pelvis and thighs. The thumb will be oriented to the outside thigh and fingers inward. Index fingers and thus comprise a large part of the thigh. Throughout the execution of this posture it is very important to keep spine and head straight.
It must also be as progressively to relax all the muscles, starting first with abdominal belt. If execution flawless, almost no muscle is not contracted and this position allows us to keep indefinitely (duration really great time) immobility of the statue, it - means - after a large enough practice. Vajrasana automatically placed at an angle basin ideal backbone.
Therefore, immediately after the engagement posture, we close our eyes, we will remove the tension in the neck and then we relax the back muscles as well. In doing so, the skull until the sacrum, the backbone is arranged correctly. It is important at this stage to not forget relaxation legs that tend to contract especially in the beginning because of the pain. As the ligaments are flexible and they found their natural length, we get to relax much better thighs, buttocks and thighs legs. In the final phase, we relax, carefully even before.",Concentration,"If in the early stages of practice experience pain in certain areas, we can overcome easily between weeks painful, focusing intensely on points or sensitive areas, relaxing while leg muscles and energizing areas of tension by focusing flows cosmic energy, to eliminate these painful outbreaks. Eventually, we can imagine that the cosmic energy flowing through the crown of our being, flooding us and making us vomit until we perceive inner state of euphoric immersion of the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe basin to the ground. When this fluid is felt overall condition, pain or outbreaks of tension, rather than increase, it will fade gradually subtle energy if we focus on them.
The proper posture without feeling awkward tension or pain, we will focus to energize perceive simultaneously two major chakras microcosm of our being.
Good execution stages, we perceive distinct activation of Ajna Chakra and Anahata Chakra simultaneously. More pronounced degree of activation of one of the two chakras, if this posture allows us to grasp is most energized between the two and to insist, through a sharp focus, tracking dynamic force center less noticeable. Energizing equal to two centers of force allows the mind influence the affective sphere and affective sphere of mental action.
Thanks to a mutual interaction, harmonious involved, this posture allows to feel, according to traditional wisdom teachings of yoga, MIND AND HEART IN HEART IN MIND.
The appropriate stimulation, simultaneous and of equal ANAHATA AJNA and CHAKRA CHAKRA, in the case that a separate charge stations yogi extraordinary state of inner force, huge, and the aggregation energy due to summation of these two centers of force mentioned above. In fact, the very name of posture (posture lightning) comes this unusual feeling of mental and emotional strength, ineffable blend.
In phases superior practice yoga, when addressed steps highest training when this posture is very well done, or in other words when we generate the feeling stable, very comfortable and relaxing euphoric, the two centers of power boost equal and are highly charged, Vajrasana can serve as the basis for certain exercises concentration (dharana), meditation {DHYANA) or a breath ritmare (PRANAYAMA). In this position, attention focuses more easily. If we intend to execute this position some concentration exercises yoga, we can easily make them if we precede these exercises a few breaths yogic deep, slow and wide to harmonize the circulation of subtle energies (Prana) throughout being .",Effects and Benefits,"In this position, compressing the leg muscles considerably hamper blood circulation in this area. Therefore, the blood that heart you normally intended legs is largely diverted to the abdominal organs. Hence its considerable influence of asana-on tube.
Sivananda yoga posture famous recommends that those with dyspepsia, those with liver disease and in general all those who suffer from weakened digestive system or ductless glands.
Vajrasana rebalance static cord. It eases and regenerates the spine. It is very useful to everybody sedentary job forces them to stay long standing (hairdressers, shop, dentists, etc.). In women, the specific position of the pelvis, lumbar and sacral region and activating the circulation in the lower belly helps eliminate certain characteristic disorders menstrual cycle or menopause.
In men, increased irrigation normalizes the production of the gonads of male hormones, the normal sexual activity was kept constant without over- strained and without diminishing feature of impotence.
Vajrasana also heals rheumatic pains in knees and gout; It is also indicated in cases of flat feet. Due to the extent of ankles and feet, is made necessary curvature, which is useful to eliminate heel pain.
Those who stay in this position for a sufficiently long will a firm attitude and a right column. They will not easily unbalanced. MERU danda (spindle vital being - spine) becomes firm and strong. This asana resembles to some extent posture NUMAZ the Muslims pray. The nerves and muscles of the legs and thighs are strengthened, myalgia (muscle pain legs and thighs) disappears. Sciatica is gradually eliminated. The stomach will work with a force increased. The practice of Vajrasana also exerts the beneficial stimulation of KANDA, the most vital part of the subtle (egg esoteric being), which is located at 30 cm above the anus, the starting nadis 72,000.
When practiced some short main meal and accompanied by deep breathing, digestion Vajrasana provides excellent and very easy. However, it is important to consider that for those with dyspepsia, it will relieve all to provide for a better chewing food meals.
The body is strong and firm in the practice of this reclaimed. Therefore, yogis called it Vajrasana, suggesting that by practicing her body becomes the diamond (Vajra). Thus, toes, knees, ankles and hips are strengthened. Posture is extremely useful for those inclined to sleep too much. It is useful pupils and students and those who work late at night. It should be practiced for 10 minutes after the meal, when the energy flow through the NADIS channels is typically lower; Vajrasana reverses this, movement, pointing it up, thereby accelerating digestion. The essence derived from digesting food becomes healthy and pure, so that the whole body, including the bones and nadis, are also diamond.
In this direction Gheranda SAMHITA says head. 2 sutra 12:

8/4/2018 16:16:45,10,asana,dandasana,Dandasana,Etymology,DANDASANA otherwise called the posture of the stick.,Performance,"Starting position is kneeling, without being put on heels. It is very important because setting correct this attitude is crucial for the correct execution posture. So we must first immobilize us in this position and move the center of gravity forward so that it becomes possible to keep the balance by relaxing the muscles thighs and buttocks. This is achieved by placing weight on us gradually and easily Rotui belly and pushing forward. We must therefore look under ""zero"" where we are perfectly balanced and relaxed. Throughout posture, attitude from start to final weight must remain in the same place (on Rotui), other muscles are relaxed. Can be moderately knees apart. When we practice relax neck muscles and neck and we let the head fall backward, following its own weight. We can possibly imagine, we head harder and he is attracted to the ground. We leave flexion back cover of almost almost all dorsal vertebrae.
Gradually, as the flexing propagated along the dorsal region, the weight of the shoulders and upper torso flexion stresses graduated column, which must remain as passive and as relaxed. We take care in order to keep the legs loose and to maintain the center of gravity in the right kneecaps. For this, you need to move forward Basin. Meanwhile we breathe as normally as possible. We then put his hands on his heels. There must be regarded as pillars of support arms, but merely to support that prevents trunk to swing ahead. Relaxing the muscles in the back (essential!) Which provides the weight of the trunk is bent spine muscles and ligaments and therefore the scope of the column. Posture will be maintained as long as possible, but given the potential respiratory distress initially will not be able to stay more than a few seconds.
Recover slowly redressing column, the sacral region to cervical vertebrae. While back weight remains always Rotui with thigh muscles relax. Arms hanging at his sides, relaxed.
By the time available, we can settle for a single execution, or asana can repeat 2-3 times. In the latter case, we will proceed in stages, ie we try to outline asana first performance, without increasing too much curvature of the spine. We will maintain a position long. Only the third execution will go to maximum (without force) and how long can we maintain, without reaching the inner state of embarrassment.",Concentration,"Concentration will focus, secondary, on the spine, keeping legs relaxed and center of gravity right kneecaps. Mainly we focus to perceive the telluric energy flows came through the legs. We refer specifically polar appearance (telluric energy (+) in the right leg, telluric energy (-) the left foot). We will refer to as activation of Manipura chakra (the navel) and the rise of energy in a single flow polarized trunk down and accumulate in the arms from shoulders to toes, where is felt the sensation of increase in volume in subtle plane, with the axis of irradiation arms. Status of energizing the arms is very striking.
When returning aware of MANIPURA CHAKRA activation state of strength, confidence and inner harmony with the outbreak of radiation solar plexus. We realize also gain magnetism in hands where we sense the aura bioenergetic purification accomplished through telluric energy, unlike the effects achieved in the execution of Talasani, which amplifies the energy field of hands is subtle cosmic nature. Hands energized in this way can be used to achieve healing through magnetic passes.",Effects and Benefits,"Abdominal massage posture produce a complex; It allows to considerably extend rearward column, helping the spring to the ground Stance practice. In this position the weight becomes our ally, as the weight of the body (head, thorax and finally the whole trunk) allows to achieve flexion rearward column. If we consider that the trunk weighs several dozen kilos understand what traction undergo back muscles and ligaments. That area is still normal, so do not risk an injury or sprain. This position is ideal to restore suppleness entire spine stiffened sedentary lifestyle.
Special effects
Supples DANDASANA the lumbar spine. It works in a very strong pelvic parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the excretion organs (colon, bladder) and genitals. It thus combat constipation by stimulating peristalsis and regulates the spinal reflex about the menstrual cycle. The sciatic nerve, which causes so much suffering in cases of sciatica is well relaxed, thus allowing to improve and heal sciatica. But if posture practice constantly emphasizes pain, we let it. Sometimes posture causes an awakening of sciatic pain but in most cases these pains disappear after a few days, thereby eliminating periodic bouts of this suffering embarrassing. If the pain is too strong we can give up position or at least to maintain an intermediate phase.
Posture has an effect on the adrenal glands. It works on mechanical and reflex nerves nephritis, thereby resulting in increased urine output on the one hand and stimulate the adrenal capsules, on the other. Is dynamic at the position, it stimulates the production of adrenaline. In case of lack of enthusiasm or despondency or neglect, it will refund the practice of this asana mood. Hiperstresate people or those whose ortosimpatic system is in a state of permanent excitement will supervise after practice this asana reactions. If posture increases their nervousness will give it up.
Sometimes posture, it occurs evening prevents us from sleep. In this case we will make morning.",Restrictions,"The main error is to distribute the weight more on feet than Rotui. Therefore, thighs and calf muscles will contract immediately. In this case, abdominal belt, which normally must remain relaxed to support passive stretching caused correctly implemented, will be contracted and resists stretching.
Other error very current is excessive support our arms. Therefore, posture lose much of its intensity and therefore reduces effectiveness. This last error is partly admissible on beginners whose back has not yet classical elasticity necessary for this position. This way of proceeding agreed on a transitional basis but is banned as soon as flexibility allows correct column.

Next, reach out with biceps facing forward and hands them sit on his knees, facing upwards, and then formed a mudra bending the middle finger and placing one against the thumb.
Some yogis applied against the bent nail of the index finger means of the thumb, thereby forming a circle. The other three fingers remain slightly bent without any tension. At this stage there should be no strain or tension, no arms or the muscles that will be as completely relaxed. The spine is perfectly straight and vertical. We take care to keep the head in a harmonious balance at the end of the spine. So we will not notify weight and will become possible to relax the muscles of the neck and neck. It will relax the face and seek the jaws are not tight.",Concentration,"Running on the left (see fig. A) that start, realize how stronger activation of Swadhistana chakra, located within the subtle two fingers above the male sexual organs (or three fingers above the clitoris in women).

a) must absolutely not be eaten 2 hours before;
b) to allow the diaphragm to rise, the lungs must be as naked and remain so throughout the year;
c) abdominal belt should be completely relaxed and remain passive - where is contracted by mistake, it will oppose the action exerted pressure so abdominal muscles do not work at all throughout the year.
d) by a false inspiration chest, diaphragm up into its highest position.

Feet (feet are spaced 30-40 cm, with feet parallel), slightly bend knees and place hands on thighs, seeking to support the entire weight of the trunk arms. To relax the abdominal belt arms must support the shoulders, keeping the body firm throughout the year.

Proper implementation
1) Exhale deeply, contracting your abs even to empty the lungs completely. Simultaneously with this we leave the ground, cringing us in order to facilitate exhalation. The remains less residual air in the lungs, the abdominal retraction RNAi will be easy.
2) came back in the starting position, Apnea vacuum, so not to let you in at all AER. Then quickly relaxed, but completely I strained abdominal belt to make a deep exhalation and further away easily realize ribs and chest deep simulacrum of inspiration. Once coasts departs slightly and rises up from the diaphragm itself and we will see, perhaps surprisingly, that belly retracts (suck) by itself without any effort of contraction.
At first it will remain that way UDDIYANA BANDHA few seconds, five seconds in the beginning, at least, and will gradually increase the duration, without reaching the inner state of embarrassment. Throughout the withdrawal period we seek to perceive potential sexual transmutation, sublimation energies in the pelvis and lower energy bringing sublimated into higher planes of being, the ""floor"" above the solar plexus. Simultaneously realize awakening latent energy essential being, Kundalini Shakti.
At the end of UDDIYANA BANDHA let chest to resume normal amplitude and zonaabdominalƒÉ to return to its usual position. Then and only then inspired! Thus air will easily enter the lungs. If we find out air simultaneously with the return of UDDIYANA BANDHA, depression existing in the thorax will cause a violent inflow of air into the lungs times, thanks to its very delicate and extreme fragility of the cellular membrane, it is not desirable and is even dangerous.
Subsequent to this inspiration, remain in full retention to moderate further appreciating the complex effects of the technique, activation of Manipura chakra and energize the solar plexus bioenergetic level.",Concentration,"Finally, realize euphoric energy gain due to inner transmutation and sublimation of the sexual potential energy upward to the upper floors of being, activation of Manipura Chakra, feeling of self-confidence, dynamism, will, Shakti Kundalini awakening subtle energy essential.",Effects and Benefits,"UDDIYANA BANDHA is a fundamental exercise in the techniques of Hatha Yoga and acts primarily on the abdomen, chest and lungs.

Where was opted for total sexual abstinence, UDDIYANA BANDHA removes feelings of tension and stress level sexual, psychically reflected by frustration, irritability or restlessness. By transmuting the sexual potential and sublimation energies at lower levels being higher in energy, UDDIYANA create a state of balance with the polar terrestrial cosmic energies, generating a state of harmony.
If we intend to create brahmacharya without excluding the exercise of sexual function, UDDIYANA BANDHA is helpful when there is a perceived high energy storage capacity exceeding own sexual control. Making them during lovemaking or immediately afterwards gives a state of elevation and amplification of the sphere of consciousness, by transmuting the sexual potential and sublimation of sexual energy, while generating a state of effervescence, dynamic euphoric energies into being.
Consistently practiced by women UDDIYANA BANDHA eliminates the pain cycle and lead to a drop period and abundance cycle. This also explains the meaning upward which gives it UDDIYANA BANDHA through transmutation and sublimation of these vital fluids.
Also, another important effect is related to the activation of latent Kundalini energy, which is in MULADHARA CHAKRA at the base of the spine.
Effects on abdomen
Abdominal organs are deprived of a sedentary because shallow breathing deprives them of rhythmic massage caused by come-and-go diaphragm seated also involving stagnation of blood in the viscera, to the detriment of those bodies. A significant amount of blood is withdrawn as general circulation, eventually ending it by our vitality diminish. Therefore, it becomes cumbersome digestion, bowel activity is slow, resulting in constipation, the more harmful as the conventional nutrition causes intestinal putrefaction, and poisoning toxins across the intestinal wall whole body. UDDIYANA BANDHA corrects this condition by massaging the deep viscera by accelerating movement in the abdomen. Thus, any body escapes its action. Digestive tract is fully stimulated. Digestion is light dyspepsia is eliminated. The stomach is also enhanced by this technique, which empties waste bag digestive juices. UDDIYANA BANDHA influence annexes digestive glands. The liver, located below the diaphragm is stimulated, decongestant, as well as the pancreas, where the islets of Langerhans secrete more insulin. Kidneys are refreshed. There is an increase of diuresis, adrenal toning, decongesting genitourinary tract and kidney ptozelor healing. BANDHA UDDIYANA combat aerophagia, causing the gas discharge.
Action on the solar plexus
The solar plexus is a nerve formation of paramount importance, Hatha Yoga is considered a true ""abdominal brain"" functions involved in regulating all located in the abdomen, action transmission to the entire nervous system. By retaining the vacuum blower UDDIYANA act on the neurovegetative pneumogastricului and restores the balance. BANDHA UDDIYANA stimulates the solar plexus and the whole extent of this region also encompasses the action Celic plexus.
Effects on the thoracic cavity
BANDHA UDDIYANA's action is not limited to abdominal. Creating a depression in the chest, it also produces effects on the diaphragm, lungs and heart. For most human beings, diaphragm - which should play a fundamental role in the act of breathing and whose piston movements should also massage the viscera while activating blood circulation - is almost blocked and less mobile. UDDIYANA BANDHA reimburse such mobility.
UDDIYANA BANDHA act on the lungs, which stimulates playing them while elasticity, while apnea with empty lungs (no hazard) strengthens them. Also the heart, which is placed between the diaphragm and lungs padded benefit from massage caused by repeated lifting of the diaphragm.",Restrictions,"Severe diseases of the abdominal organs or running a contraindication colitis, appendicitis, ulcers etc. If the condition is ignored, UDDIYANA BANDHA will cause severe pain. In such a case, moderate technical and resume later you feel these phenomena as endangered. Abdominal Ptozele not a contraindication, this technique removing them. Also UDDIYANA BANDHA is contraindicated children under 12 years, women during menstruation and pregnant women.",Further Details,"In the case of UDDIYANA BANDHA yogis have developed a unique method for acting on the autonomic nervous system by playing abdominal muscles. An accelerating excessive activity of parasympathetic activity of the digestive tract, while hyperactivity of the sympathetic a down; in health there is a balance between the two. Any hyperactivity of a branch of the autonomic system automatically increases the activity of the other, to create a balance. BANDHA UDDIYANA harmonious stimulates the activity of these two branches of the autonomic nervous system. Their interaction regulates involuntary organs.

8/5/2018 22:47:06,19,asana,nauli-kriya,Nauli-Kriya,Etymology,"Naul word is not found in conventional dictionaries. ""ULLOLA"" which means very high wave, expressed somewhat basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe processes through which the Naul. In this technique the muscles and the abdominal organs are moved vertically and transversely in a move similar to the waves. NAU means boat and LI means ""to keep"", ""settle down"", ""to join."" Rocking of a boat on a rough sea suggests how the abdominal muscles move in Naul technique. Gheranda SAMHITA naming process LAUKIKI - yoga, says the lesson I Sutra 52: ""Move with great force stomach and intestines from side to side. This is called LAUKIKI - YOGA. It destroys all diseases and increases the digestive fire"" . Kriya or Nauli is a process and not reclaimed. In traditional yogic texts Naul is mentioned as one of the six acts purifier (Shat - KARMA).",Performance,"In this technique (Naul - kriya) should represent us before all that consciousness and voluntary movement two processes are intimately linked. Assiduous practice of UDDIYANA BANDHA favor this OUTLET OF CONSCIENCE on all muscle and abdominal belt. When the yogi masters well UDDIYANA BANDHA, he can address his practice Naul, focusing intensely on the insertion of large rectus muscles semifizei pubic. We thus find it easier to acquire control of a muscle from its insertion point. View will be a real help in this direction, allowing us to locate muscles. For this will remove any garment that covers the abdominal area to look abdomen during training.
The proper technical execution
It adopts the same starting position as the UDDIYANA BANDHA. Make a strong exhale through the mouth, down squat, then stand up keeping vacuum retention, placing hands above the knees, which will be slightly bent. Will withdraw diaphragm and abdominal organs vacuum force created by trying to glue abdomen backbone. This is UDDIYANA BANDHA first Naul prior art. Then leave the area in the middle of the abdomen contracting right and left abdominal belt. The rectus abdominal stress in this position will be in the form of a vertical line. This stage is called madhyama - Naul. The next step will be contracted from the right hand side of the abdomen leaving free. Muscles will highlight only the left side of the abdomen. This stage is called VAMA - Naul. Then turn right abdominal muscle in the left half of the abdomen, slowly. In more advanced stages of practice rotation can be made faster. Contracted abdomen then left leaving the right free. Muscles will highlight only the right side of the abdomen. This stage is called Dakshin - Naul. Then turn right abdominal muscle in the right half of the abdomen slowly a number of times equal to the number of revolutions of the left side. Finally, the diaphragm descends and after about 5 seconds inspiration, just like UDDIYANA BANDHA.
To begin with, if they fail to isolate the abdominal muscles, will be achieved in the first phase, the vacuum in the containment, a movement of retraction of the abdomen down and then successively as many times as possible. After about two weeks of consistent, rectus abdominis muscle will highlight the central part of the abdomen. If it still is difficult to realize the movement of the muscles to the left and to the right will be executed sequentially, and isolating the retraction of the abdominal rectus abdominis muscle central many times as possible.
Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof Execution
Sacred writings say that the movement must be like a wave on the river.
DURATION OF THE YEAR
Remarkable results obtained by Naul occur if a practice is devoted to three minutes per day. Advanced yogis practice Naul from quarter hour to half an hour a day.
",Concentration,,Effects and Benefits,"Naul is an excellent example of development control of those muscles that hardly use them individually. On their separate existence most people are not aware. Rectus abdominis (that is as the front wall of the abdominal cavity) normally used together with other transversus abdominis muscle like, etc. Exercise contracting the rectus abdominis muscle individually and independently depends on dissociation and intuition functions of each group of muscles of the abdominal plexus. Once trained in this mass movement of isolating muscle control can achieve extremely high dynamic pressure on the abdomen. Rectus abdominis muscle movement will improve various viscera, enhancing blood circulation. Plexus nerve endings and their end will also be activated. This will result in better coordination between the autonomous functions RNAi specific abdominal cavity.
Naul being immunized from diseases like hernia, duodenal ulcer, indigestion, constipation, colic.
MASSAGE depression
The effects of this technique, exclusive and characteristic Hatha - Yoga, are spectacular.
The alternation of pressure and successive depressions in the whole trunk exceptional effects, engaging all the viscera as well as certain vital plexus. From this follows an acceleration of blood irrigation, not only in the trunk but also organs throughout the body.
Naul is an unparalleled abdominal massage, massage any process used other than Naul viscera are never achieved only by muscle layers and often abdominal fat belt. In Naul even abdominal belt is that massage viscera. The real difference is much deeper than the country might assume at first glance.
This situation creates a depression, so we have a massage by sucking progressive depression of all organs. Instead of expelling blood by compressing the muscles, the valley attracts here in abundance flooding that arterial blood drives in front of venous blood in the abdominal organs, resulting in stimulation of all organs of the abdomen. This stimulation is to grow large scale dynamism and vitality of the body in general.
This action is exerted not only on the tube itself, where Naul radically eliminates constipation, but also on other organs, especially the kidneys. Increased diuresis and kidney health is ensured.
Most spectacular structure is influenced by Naul solar plexus, which will decongestant. If you remember its role abdominal brain and its action on all abdominal organs, we realize the importance of art.
It is noteworthy that the solar plexus is also physiologically resonator all our anxieties. Naul's practice spread quickly so emotional state
anxiety that triggers everyday life. Naul is so deep in the emotional repercussions.
To score more specifically abdominal viscera action to remember:
- Liver, whose multiple functions make it one of the most important organs of the body will be greatly increased internal movement, a situation that will allow him to play much better role for which the benefit of the whole body physiologically.
- Gall bladder is massaged tremendously. If however there calculated Naul can cause movement, possibly triggering them in many cases eviction if their size is too large. Nascent calculi can also be removed by this technique.
- The pancreas also will benefit from this massage internally even if Naul can not heal immediately diabetes, he will still be able to ensure the proper functioning of this gland here ranging and islets of Langerhans - producing insulin, the hormone that allows to maintain constant blood sugar percentage. As most people consume too much sugar, we submit this organ to a hard test, Naul allows to successfully face a pregnancy increased.
- The kidneys. A yogi adage says that having good kidneys and a healthy heart can become a centenarian. Day and night to protect us against autointoxicarii kidneys. They therefore deserve to be toned. More posts Yoga promotes renal irrigation, however, Naul is unmatched for kidney health, here ranging and adrenals.
- abdominal muscle effects
Abdominal belt importance can not be underestimated. Naul is the best way to strengthen and control. Massage lateral abdominal region during his Naul is not only beneficial for the viscera, but abdominal belt whose specific role is to maintain organs in place.
- Effects on the heart and lungs
Naul's practice deep acting on these vital organs considered among the worst treated of civilized man, who left his lungs atrophy, ""forgetting"" to breathe deeply while his heart is at risk of stroke.
Naul requires prior elimination of all residual air as possible, which is eminently favorable for lung health. This total exhalation diaphragm to come up very high in the chest, the chest cavity is brought into depression, which is to fold in the lungs themselves, keeping them elasticity, the capital element to their health ""
Measurements performed in hospitals yoga in Lonavla, India have shown that Naul causes a depression of the order of 42 mm of mercury in the esophagus and stomach, which is exceptional .. This depression is no danger of the small, so heart and the lungs with exactly the opposite effects.
Regarding the heart, by alternating pressure and depressions caused by Naul, followed or preceded by breathing belt controlled, it is massaged deeply and vigorously state that facilitates feeding the heart muscle and is one of the best protection against stroke .
Naul is therefore as important to the health of the lungs and heart, as to the abdominal organs.",Restrictions,"This exercise is contraindicated in women during the cycle and early in pregnancy status, and children under 12 years.
If Naul causes very severe pain, it is certainly hint of an abnormal condition in the abdomen colitis Severe, chronic appendicitis, tuberculosis, intestinal or stomach cancer. In this case suspended practice. 0 very high blood pressure, over 16, is also contraindicated in Naul.",Further Details,"Yoga Hatha yoga PRADIPIKA famous treatise, Chapter II, aphorism 35, states:
""Naul is the most important and most valuable of all practices physical Hatha yoga. He does greatly increase the fire digestion, eases assimilation, produces a feeling extremely pleasant awakening Kundalini transmitted on a high energy creative power ( sexual) increases will and destroy all suffering "".",http://pranayoga.co.in/asana/wp-content/uploads/Vama-nauli-left.jpg

Treaties mentioned in traditional Hatha-Yoga, DHANURASANA is renowned for its effectiveness. For beginners or those who have never practiced it, it may seem difficult asana and can be staplnitƒÉ only by force and violence. In fact, for the correct execution of DHANURASANA not only require a great force, but even indispensable to practice effortlessly.",Performance,"Lying on the ground, face down, chin up while simultaneously ankles and hands grabbed the back is arched. Beginners can grab an ankle first, then the other. Feet is the only element when executing DHANURASANA engine. Even arms remain passive; like the string of a bow, it is straight and merely unite shoulders ankles. To perform this asana should push the front legs and up, with a strong contraction of the thighs and legs, shoulders and arches that rise behind. During this asana should not strained so than calves and thighs; contracting for example behind makes it impossible asana. At first it does not lift your knees only slightly and the price of thigh muscle pain. But with perseverance, we are able to place your knees above the plane chin peaking at the tip skull. In this case the pubic area is clear of the ground and the body weight presses on the upper abdomen (upper abdomen between the navel and the sternum), which makes greatly increase the intra-abdominal pressure, giving a maximum effective technique because this pressure is transmitted entirely abdominal viscera. By taking this position the start phase consisting of a dynamic balance at exactly that of a boat in the waves; made easy at first, this balance initially limited to the groin, emphasizing the then little by little until the fulcrum moves from chest to thighs, thus achieving a very deep abdominal massage.
DURATION dynamic phase
This time of course depends on the individual possibilities, taking care however not cross these boundaries. Generally enough table balancing 4-12. To make it easier we can divide this phase 2 or 3 steps back to the starting position after each step to relax.
Breathing during the dynamic phase
During the dynamic phase can breathe in three ways:
a) inspiration when the head is up, exhale as it moves down;
b) the normal breathing all the time)
c) holding the breath, with full lungs; This variant is reserved for advanced followers.

EFFECTS ON THE MUSCLES
At first, this technique can cause pain in the legs, but after a few days of practice, the pain will be removed. abdominal belt stretching facilitates UDDIYANA BANDHA. Euphoria and feelings of consecutive release of the posts from the stimulation of nerve centers of the spine, particularly the sympathetic nervous system, the chain of which node is along the spine. Asana has powerful effects on the solar plexus, the complex area of ‚Äã‚Äãrecess nervous stomach, massaging and stimulating rocking with great effectiveness this area. We know that anxiety is accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in the stomach recess due to congestion solar area, which negatively influences the autonomic functions, causing countless functional disorders resistant to current therapeutics. Balancing and stretching the abdominal muscles are added to massage resulting in deep and diaphragmatic breathing, all scattering events described above.
Effects on cellulite and fattening

- poor assimilation of food
- poor circulation in areas of cellulite.
Arch acting posture by:
- increased respiration
- solar plexus congestion

8/5/2018 23:53:30,21,asana,prasarita padatanasana,Prasarita Padatanasana,Etymology,"This ASANA has the advantage of being both a flexion position and an inverted position in front. It takes its name from the Sanskrit word ""PRASARITA"" which means ""light"", ""extended"" and to ""pada"" - leg.",Performance,"Starting from standing, feet removed at least 1.20 meters, or even more, depending on the length of the legs. Thus, you will find appropriate distance, trying to approach full position. If it happens, however, we fail to ground our head, we seek to remove more legs every new attempt to execute posture. Bringing the head thus found that the soil is closely related to the degree of the feet away from one another. The legs are apart, the position will be achieved more easily. If we fail yet still we head to the ground, we will persevere towards gradual legs remoteness. While bust lean forward to run full posture, place your palms on the ground as close as possible to an imaginary straight line connecting your heels. At first, however, you can place your hands even before this line. Further, as we progress, you will come closer palms that line and you will finally put behind her. Coming full position, lean forward until you reach the head on the ground. Support base of the head must be completely symmetrical form a perfect equilateral triangle. We put your elbows on the ground, then applying each hand on the opposite arm. In this way we determine the exact distance between the elbows. Next we catch fingers bracelet, coming with the forehead on the ground. It is very important to support the head on the ground exactly on the border between the forehead and covered with hair. It is not advisable to lean on the forehead or on the head. Thus, we remain from 10-20 minutes in this position. Throughout the execution will take care that your feet are slipping on the floor. In this direction is recommended training in this posture on the bare ground or on a non-slip floor, as if the head or feet move or moves away, it will involve muscular effort to prevent them from moving.

Notify the aggregation energy captured polar level of Muladhara Chakra and perceive the transmutation of vital energies amplified able effervescence, making the center column to the level of Sushumna Nadi sublimation of these energies in the form of increasingly subtle finally realizing accumulation and transmutation of these energies over the top, outside the body, the Sahasrara, where the sublimation process reached its climax. Make such activation of Sahasrara. Secondary focus on abdominal compression due spontaneous deep exhalation, and the resulting massage.",Effects and Benefits,"This position relatively easily accessible stations combined effects of flexion before those of stations simultaneously reversed. It is especially indicated as preparatory SHIRSHASANA posture (standing on his head) and shore especially those who have difficulties in terms of activation of Sahasrara.
EFFECTS spine: spine Supples during flexion phase. Vertebral discs supports increased pressure, however they earn their great elasticity. The ligaments are stretched and more flexible spine.
Muscle effects: the spine muscles and ligaments are stretched, the muscles of the calves suffering more pronounced elongation. These muscles expresses otherwise there during execution posture. This technique quickly return them to normal length. Throughout shrinkage during expiration deep abdominal belt is fortified.
EFFECTS ON THE ROAD: intracerebral circulation is more active, somewhat as in the case of Sarvangasana; because the height of the column of blood is reduced, the pressure of the blood vessels in the brain will therefore be proportionally less strong. Circulation is also accelerated throughout the trunk, so that the abdominal organs will benefit greatly. The liver and stomach are the main beneficiaries in this direction. The movement is strongly increased in the liver and blood will be literally sucked through the vena cava. This asana smooth functioning of the digestive tract and removes stagnation of blood in the abdominal organs. We know that we stazele sedentary cases of venous blood from the gut reduces the overall vitality of the body. Thanks to this technique is recycled as postural blood flow to the heart and lungs to be purified there. In terms of benefits for the body, circulatory effects of PASCHIMOTTANASANA distinguish where the flow of blood to the head is less pronounced.
EFFECTS ON NERVES: The spinal cord is stretched and toned and sympathetic ganglia located next spine are stimulated. The main beneficiary will be especially sciatic nerve, which tends to release your posture to its area of ‚Äã‚Äãoccurrence of the spine so that it is stretched when thigh muscle extension. This stretch is very favorable to them, forming an excellent prevention against sciatic pain or crises of this kind. However, if the sciatic nerve is irritated, it would be contraindicated to practice this posture, especially if the pain is getting worse every day in practice.
Subtle effects: This position is excellent for transmuting lower energies and is especially indicated for people with a very great vitality. It allows activation of SAHASRARA the lower planes and will be even more effective with some practitioners with a load TAMAS-ic, than SHIRSHASANA, thereby facilitating activation key center, even if people do not feel at all.",,,,,https://www.yogalacrosse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/prasarita-padottanasana-I-bks.jpg

Effects procured different from those in the dynamic phase during the period of immobility which succeeds. Dynamic phase produces a general stimulation of the nerve fibers distributed along the spine, thanks to the slow running which in addition gives a perfect elasticity of the spine, tonific√¢nd lymph throughout the body and acting on the sympathetic chain. Abdominal muscles that raised the trunk, thus strengthened. During phase static effects resulting from compressing the abdomen against the legs, while the contraction of abdominal toning belt viscera.

Effect on the spinal column. PADANGHUSTHASANA are complemented by HALASANA (plow posture). They combine their action mainly in the static phase. HALASANA acting on the upper part of the spine, while the pelvic PADANGHUSTHASANA tones. During these two asanas, the vertebrae are easily removed, thus releasing the nerve fiber coming out of the spaces conjugation. Stretching muscles sharp vertebral groove away from here the blood, which makes the return to the normal position to show blood flow favoring irrigation spinal cord.
Effects on the nervous system and muscles. Outside spine muscles, abdominal belt is reinforced. Muscles and ligaments of the back legs are stretched and massage, as well as nerves. This posture has therapeutic effects in cases of sciatica, nerve releasing and stretching it. Static final stage, outside the spinal nervous system, the solar plexus is deeply stimulated and decongestant. This position helps therefore to spread anxiety states, with balancing effect on the psyche.
Effects on abdominal organs. No organ of the abdominal cavity escapes stimulatory action of this posture. Remarkable effects on the prostate. Sexual activity is influenced towards a normalization posture redinamiz√¢ndu them those whose sexual power weakens without causing morbid excitement. This is why awakening and returning to normal sexual activity even when advanced age. From the physical point of view there is a re-establishment of the gonadal activity, whose hormones have profound repercussions on health have been linked to conditions that produce surprising rejuvenation in the practice of yoga. Thanks to PADANGHUSTHASANA, this will occur without resorting to animal gland extracts or drugs, because even individual glands to produce hormones irreplaceable resume. These effects apply to both the male and the female uterus and ovaries where they will benefit greatly from this posture. Outside the pancreas, especially stimulated and toned by this asana, liver, kidney, bladder are favorably influenced, is activated simultaneously peristalsis, especially in the colon and large intestine. Many cases of obstipation are permanently removed, often only after 2-3 weeks. However, in some people, to maintain this asana more than 5 minutes can, conversely, to produce an increase in constipation. Each practitioner will be so cautious, seeking to take downtime to be increased gradually while checking the effects that occur.
Effects on lymph flow. Lymphatic circulation acts on this strong position, √Ænarm√¢ndu us effectively fight infection.

This asana can bring helpful and men is one of the few asana'm diagonally acting on the back. Systematically asana, they act in the sagittal plane of the spine. However, except for items torsion, dorsal oblique muscles are not too stretched and elongated. In spring the lifting and these oblique muscles are put into action.
This position often favors classic Arc learning which in many cases is an asana quite difficult, especially if the student is not sufficiently relax the back muscles.

As stated by the great yogi Sivananda, Atman is a sphere with center and radius into being infinite. This spiritual reality last that the same nature with the Divine can be known by rational means, scientific, logical, deductive or otherwise, because it is the very nature connoisseurs Ultimate, whereby anything can be known, but , not by anything and having no other previous case can not be met in the usual sense of the word, but lived through the identification of its nature. This is the state of a human being who attained enlightenment. There are a reflection of the Self in structures (subtle bodies of) our being, through which we can refer - as a child sees in the mirror lake reflection Sun and understand so little about the actual existence and sunshine - individual Supreme Self (Atman ). This reflection is called JIVATMA and includes aspects of being the highest structures of Koshi ANANDAMAYA bodies (body bliss) and VIJNANAMAYA Kosh (body of knowledge) accompanying Ultimate Individual Self (Atman) from one incarnation to another.
In Sankhya philosophy, JIVA (soul) is regarded as the consequence of the union of individual spiritual consciousness (PURUSHA) and the principle of unconscious material energy (Prakriti). PURUSHA principle is eternally pure and free. This is another name for Individual Self - Atman - which is never subject to ignorance and enslavement in illusion. Prakriti but acts as a receiver when in contact with PURUSHA and receives light. Every being is divine in its ultimate spiritual reality, however partial it may seem to us in its current manifestation in nature. Spirit manifested in each of its many individual existence is eternal, unborn and undying, but still capable of improvement, the same unique existence. This spirit manifested JIVA is generally regarded as a living creature, but in reality it is more than momentary appearance and should not be limited only to human appearance.
In the process of evolution, JIVA gradually come to rise above the limitations caused by ignorance. In essence, it is self-consciousness. He knows himself and knows others! Self reflecting light, it shines all. Matter has no self-awareness. She can not know and can not know anything. When water is evaporated from a lake, the water is absorbed by the reflection of the sun even the sun. In this case, water vapor rises to the sun. Similarly, when the lower self structures are annihilated and transmuted and sublimated into coarse energies higher energies, the JIVATMA, free of any veil limited, it is immersed in the divine.

As a result, the amount of blood that can not be reached in the calf and foot excessive irrigation and other areas of the body existing in the first organs in the abdominal cavity.

Twisting lower thighs to lead the trend of outward lateral movement of the femoral neck of coxal-femoral joint. Consequently, this increases the degree of freedom of the joints when moving in the opposite direction, such as placing the ground side of the thighs, PADMASANA required.

8/13/2018 12:47:12,120,"hatha, dhauti",vamana dhauti,Vamana Dhauti,Etymology,"In Sanskrit, Vamana means middle, and DHAUTI means purification, cleansing.
Traditional yogic literature, this technique is known as the Kunja, or gesture elephant.
Famous treatise yoga BHAKTI Sagar Granth mentions about this process:
""The known as a gesture elephant immunized body against all diseases. This process results in a non fill the stomach with water, to give it turns out without effort. As elephant draws water from the river to the trunk, giving it turns out all the trunk, and keeps this way the body of any trouble, just as man can conserve their body free of any disease. as a clay pot clean water, so we can wash the stomach with warm water. """,Performance,"Heat at least 2 liters of water, or even more, up to a temperature slightly higher than that of the body. Optional can be added to the entire eye a spoonful of sea salt or common salt the same amount of crude. Doing so will be more effective cleaning.
Position to absorb water
We squat, crouched, standing on heels and soles. This posture is called KAGASANA. Knees will be removed to not compress the stomach. Hot water, or pure salt will drink without interruption until satiety or filler installed. You will have to absorb at least a liter of water or, if possible, a liter and a half. If you create nausea salt water, you can drink pure water. If, by the end, it creates a feeling sick it is really good.
Once it has absorbed the minimum amount of water needed, raise your posts.

stirring
Before you dispose of water, leave it for a while in the stomach, in the range 10-20 excut√¢nd abdominal retractions (as UDDIYANA BANDHA, but without maintaining retraction). This will produce an incomparable internal cleansing anticipation main phase elimination.

The elimination
To give the water out, it is important to follow some very precise.
Never attempt to remove water with bust right. Proceed as follows:
- close slightly heels;
- Bend your torso forward to bringing it to an angle of 90 degrees to feet, in other words, horizontal;
- before vomiting water, press with your left hand in the hollow stomach, beneath the breastbone, while sucking the womb without it tight, as UDDIYANA BANDHA. This firm pressure of the hand makes evacuation easier and more complete, because with them we already reurce stomach water to where the esophagus opens and thus siphon primer. Therefore, the evacuation will be done with less effort and with fewer sobbing, vomiting, because the amount of water removed each time will be higher;
- joined index finger, the middle and the right hand ring. If nails are large, cut them so as not to hurt neck, and if a woman can use a rubber surgical glove. Then open your mouth and three fingers, cone, as deep down throat. In general, a slight pressure to the root of the tongue, near the velum will be enough to trigger reflex vornitativ. If reflex is triggered, it is achieved easily, as the tickling even velum. At first, the water will come in small jets, but after the first two or three jets, more important amounts of water are removed with each contraction. If tense muscles of lower belly area to create a bottom-up pressure on the stomach, removal will be much easier. Between sobbing, vomiting rest awhile, breathe calmly, wipe your fingers and face.

If you look you will find that it vomits water became yellow and foamy. Continue as long as you exit the water. At last you will observe polyphase flow throat a kind of bitterness, indicating unmistakably that excess bile was unlocked and removed. You'll then be sure that you make a good cleaning. At this stage only, you can drink a glass of water for the final cleaning (not to be removed).
Relax then shavasana 5-10 minutes before proceeding to execution ASANA-s. If you do not make asana'm not eating earlier than half an hour.

The timing of the execution
Vamana DHAUTI practiced fasting and in this direction, the morning is the best time. However, in some cases, it may be practical with a maximum efficacy even on a full stomach; for example, when greed or forced by certain circumstances, eating and drinking more than they should. When lying on the bed, before falling asleep, we might spend a bad night, populated by nightmares, digesting awkward because, ultimately, the morning to get up more tired than to sleep, exhausted and unable to carry out any serious work .
In general, it is good to know that excess food fermenting and we more or less unbalanced digestive system. The optimal solution in these situations is to use lightning to Vamana DHAUTI to evacuate the surplus as quickly and as completely RNAi.
Sometime after implementation, we felt better, we congratulate thought we did take this wise decision.
What will happen though if treated water, despite follow all indications can not be vomited remaining in the stomach without being eliminated? In such a situation we should not anxious at all, because it will remove itself from the normal escape path liquids.
Persevering in the implementation process, we will gain the necessary experience and we will increasingly better, with minimal effort and without the slightest difficulty. Finally, the technique will become a reflex and will be carried out very quickly.

Frequency of execution
In cases where there are some diseases that can be cured by this method, it is good practice to Vamana DHAUTI every day. The same is indicated for yogis who want to purify themselves very well, especially in the beginning of yoga practice, or when we feel full load or toxins.
Schools of yoga in India, beginners do this process daily for 45 days, then one day two the same period and so continue to get progressively to a purification week, this frequency is sufficient for those who have a diet balanced, encompassing fewer foods that rot.",Concentration,,Effects and Benefits,"If every human being who eat meat 2-3 times a day is sure that it will have a permanent source of rotting body. It can be said that such a being circulated animal corpses consumed, which can be assimilated with putrescible substances. Therefore, external cleanliness, visible, must be completed by the domestic cleaning, the latter is even more important.
To be convinced of the usefulness of this process, we carefully examine the language. If we find that it is loaded, there are many risks that things will stay the same with the stomach wall. Here √ÆncleiazƒÉ literally mucus lining, disrupts millions of glands secreting gastric juices and thus hamper their activities. In this situation, digestion can not take place flawlessly. Assimilation will be even better as the stomach wall will be cleaner. In addition, our embarrassing tendency to eat fast makes it all Imperata RNAi need to have a full stomach in shape, so that digestion can take place in acceptable conditions. We can ask: ""If my stomach digest better, do not I get fat?"" In reality, this is so: because assimilate wrong, so wrong, resulting cellulite or excess fat and never because our stomachs digest well. Thus, as a way to test if your digestive system is in perfect condition and if we eat properly, without excess food to make us fattening (animal fat, sugar, industrial alcohol) and if our breath is enough normal , the weight will remain stable, this stability is, in fact, verify, or the index of a state of biological balance and health.
From another point of view, it is essential to periodically remove debris from the stomach pouch, whose shape is known. The sedentary particularly, its bottom part is abnormal; they distorted or distended stomach due to excess food. Often this is characteristic even big eaters soup. Even some vegetarians absorbing a lot of vegetables can also provide this deformation.
If the stomach is deformed, he never empties completely, leaving him almost permanently residues acidified, causing rot or sour. At the next table, the waste is mixed with fresh food, this situation disturbing the digestive process and end up irritating the lining of the stomach and intestines. Some yogic methods corrects this situation, for example certain asana-s, especially reverse positions. However their effect to be completed by Vamana DHAUTI, which is a radical and incomparable way.
Due to periodic execution of Vamana DHAUTI, all residue is removed and the stomach is completely purified this result our health is improving. DHAUTI VAMANA act, inter alia, favorably in cases of obesity, dyspepsia, hyperacidity of the stomach and acreli.
In medicine today, is done but also washing stomach using a probe; By comparison, VAMANA DHAUTI is a superior method. Here, under the influence of UDDIYANA BANDHA, the wash water existing in the stomach is designed with a force in all directions, even dome wetting the stomach, while the cleaned probe lavage performed using only the lower and middle parts of the stomach. In addition, tubing does not trigger reflex reactions never so strong and the effect of which will be described below.
Also, Vamana DHAUTI not irritate esophagus and leads all rubber, does not involve any equipment or help anyone. It can easily practice at home whenever we want.

Action on muscles
Vomit reflex is triggered by a center located in the bulb at the base of the brain, but the content of the stomach is removed due to the strong contractions of the diaphragm, the abdominal belt, as well as other muscles, so to be toned.

Effects on obesity
Although seemingly paradoxical, better assimilation of food, DHAUTI Vamana's subsequent practice, prevents the formation of adipose tissue and cellulite.

Action on the liver; intestines and kidneys
Strong contraction of the diaphragm and mechanical act directly on the liver, Vamana DHAUTI also by reflex regulating liver functions. The intestines are also stimulated by reflex. The kidneys, in turn, take part in the overall activation, resulting in increase in diuresis. Even the heart and lungs, although they are on the upper floor, benefiting from the contraction of the diaphragm, which strengthens this strong action is favorable even certain cardiac excluded from the cases referred to contraindications.
Technical cleans the skin, pimples and boils √ÆndepƒÉrtazƒÉ, heal diseases teeth balances excretory function eliminates constipation, suffering related to the secretion of bile, indigestion, coughing, rickets, tonsillitis, insomnia etc. The list is not exhaustive.

In conclusion, practicing DHAUTI Vamana, the stomach will be net advantage and improved digestion and relief, in addition benefiting from other effects mentioned above.",Restrictions,"People with serious damage to the stomach or digestive tract (ulcers, cancer) will not achieve DHAUTI Vamana, the ban is still valid for those suffering from heart damage or a high net pronounced.",,,
